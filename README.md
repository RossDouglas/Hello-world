# Hello-world

This is my first ever github script. I don't even know if script is the right name for what I'm doing right now but with time that will (possibly) change.

I'm dyslexic and will probably make many errors and screw things up but that's how we learn huh? Trial and error, adapt, improvise, overcome and all that jazz.
